{"id":842,"count":423,"description":"The <strong>sofa<\/strong> is an important piece of furniture that is a part of almost every home. The living room is the place that is known to be the home to <strong>sofa sets<\/strong> in a maximum of cases. Of course, there are so many times when people also love to have a <strong>single sofa<\/strong> in some other parts of the house too, such as in the bedroom or in the library.\r\n\r\nThe living room of a house is not just the place where you welcome your guests. It is also the prime location where all the family members sit together to spend quality family time. Thus, when the whole family is gathered in the living room, you require more space to sit, and there is nothing better than a sofa in the living room. You can opt for a basic sofa to a luxurious one or from a minimalist design to a heavier one, depending upon your interiors and your taste.","link":"https:\/\/www.alankaram.in\/product-category\/sofa\/","name":"Sofa","slug":"sofa","taxonomy":"product_cat","parent":0,"meta":[],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.alankaram.in\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/product_cat\/842"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.alankaram.in\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/product_cat"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.alankaram.in\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/taxonomies\/product_cat"}],"wp:post_type":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.alankaram.in\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/product?product_cat=842"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
